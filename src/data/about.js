    text: `Who am I? Well, let's start saying that I love work, study and challenges. I'm very responsible, honest and pacient. I'm 36, married and have no child. I also love to travel, nature landscapes, strategy games, classical music and heavy metal, sometimes, and, of course, eat! I studyed physics for 12 years, reaching PhD degree and started a career as a professor, actuating in many universities for seven years, but my country have not been investing in this department as they should, what allowed me to look for new horizons. I discovered programming world 2 years ago and I found myself fascinated by web development, which is what I've liked the most. By now, definitively, this is what I wanna be profissinally. Since than, i'm dive down deep in MERN stack.`,
